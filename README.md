## How to Use

### Today's Tasks
Shows all tasks due today in priority order:
1. Recurring tasks (green)
2. Workout exercises (blue)
3. General to-dos (gray)

Completed tasks automatically move to the bottom.

### General To-Dos
- Add one-time tasks
- Check them off when complete
- Delete when no longer needed
- Completed tasks persist until you delete them

### Recurring Tasks
- Set tasks to repeat every 1-30 days
- Check off when complete today
- Automatically reappear when due again
- Great for: taking vitamins, watering plants, weekly reviews, etc.

### Workout Plans
- **View Mode**: See all your workout plans
- **Edit Mode**: Add/edit/delete plans and exercises
- **Auto-Rotation**: First plan is today's workout, automatically rotates to next plan each day
- **Reorder**: Use up/down arrows to change the workout schedule

### Export/Import
Click "Settings" at the bottom to:
- **Export Backup**: Download your data as JSON
- **Import Backup**: Restore from a previous backup
- Use this to sync between devices or backup regularly

## Data Storage

All your data is stored locally in your browser's localStorage:
- **Location**: Browser local storage only
- **Privacy**: Never leaves your device
- **Persistence**: Data survives page refresh
- **Backup**: Use export/import for backups and cross-device sync

3. Now it works like a native app!

## Tips
